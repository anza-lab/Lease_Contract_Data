                                                      Definition of a First Time Buyer

For consistency, Homes England has adopted HMRC’s definition of a first time buyer and in order to count

as a first time buyer, a purchaser must not, either alone or with others, have previously acquired a major

interest in a dwelling or an equivalent interest in land situated anywhere in the world.

This includes previous acquisitions by inheritance or gift, or by a financial institution on behalf of a person

under an alternative finance scheme.

If the Property is being purchased jointly, all of the purchasers must meet these conditions.
